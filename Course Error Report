For the error I have found in a part of my code was mostly html issues
with the post component. 

I had trouble getting the columns for the posts right so it just looked like 
a jambled mess. While it may not be the most critical issue 
it still distracted from the webpage, which is points off in my book.

I would label this error as an oversight issue.
